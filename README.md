# push.py

Command line utility for sending push notifications using [Pushover](https://pushover.net)

## Installation

Copy `push.py` to a directory in your `$PATH`.

## Prerequisite

You'll need a free account with [Pushover](https://pushover.net/). Once you
have that, log in and [register an
application](https://pushover.net/apps/build). You should now have two
codes---a **user key** and an **API token/key**. These are what identify you
and your app(s) to Pushover. You'll pass these along to pushoverr whenever you
send a message.
